# RayTracer

This project was developed in just **6 days** at **ENSTA Paris** as part of the course **CSC_4IN04_TA**, in collaboration with my classmate. The goal was to implement a basic ray tracing engine from scratch, progressively building up features to render simple 3D scenes with realistic lighting.

## 📅 Project Timeline

The work is organized in six files, each representing the progress made on a specific day


## 🖼️ Features Implemented

- Ray-sphere intersection
- Camera positioning and viewing rays
- Basic Phong shading
- Light source handling and shadow casting
- Scene description hardcoded in code

## 🚀 Future Work

In the future, we aim to explore **parallel computing** techniques (e.g., multithreading or GPU acceleration) to **speed up image rendering**, especially for complex scenes or higher resolutions.

## 🛠️ How to Run

Make sure you have a C++ compiler. Compile and run one of the daily files like so:

```bash
g++ day6.cpp -o raytracer
./raytracer
