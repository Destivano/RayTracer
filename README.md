# RayTracer
RayTracer is a project developed at ENSTA Paris as part of the CSC_4IN04_TA course, in collaboration with my classmate. The goal was to implement a basic ray tracing engine from scratch, capable of rendering 3D scenes with realistic lighting, shadows, and reflections using fundamental geometric and lighting algorithms
